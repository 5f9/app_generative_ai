As we previously saw, these models must run inside your notebook's VM, so you are limited to small-large language models. The models supported inside of Kaggle are well-defined, and Kaggle designed their notebooks to facilitate using these models. Many of these models will work with or without a GPU; however, CPU-only configuration will be very slow.\n\nSome of the models automatically supported by Kaggle include:\n\nEfficient Net\nFLUX 3.1\nGemma\nLamma 3.1\nYOLO-v8\n\n## The Gemma LLM\n\nThe Gemma model family, developed by Google DeepMind, offers cutting-edge performance in two sizes: 2B and 7B parameters. These models integrate seamlessly with popular machine learning platforms, including Kaggle, allowing easy deployment and experimentation. Gemma's lightweight architecture ensures it can deliver top-tier results, even compared to larger models, making it ideal for developers looking to balance performance and efficiency. The pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions of Gemma provide flexibility for both general-purpose and fine-tuned applications while maintaining Google's high standards for safety and responsible AI usage.\n\nGemma's compatibility with Kaggle extends to ready-to-use notebooks and integration with common tools like Hugging Face, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. This capability makes it a great option for users familiar with the Kaggle ecosystem who wish to experiment or fine-tune the models for specific tasks. The ability to deploy Gemma models on local devices and in cloud environments like Google Cloud ensures versatility for various applications, from research projects to commercial use. In our upcoming projects, we will focus on the 2B and 7B versions of the Gemma models to explore their capabilities and optimize them for our use cases.\n\n\nThe following code makes use of the Gemma model. \n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"LFMTMsOWAgyS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import keras\nimport keras_nlp\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"KERAS_BACKEND\"] = \"jax\"  # Or \"tensorflow\" or \"torch\".\n\ngemma_lm = keras_nlp.models.GemmaCausalLM.from_preset(\"gemma_2b_en\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-07T11:29:32.411601Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-07T11:29:32.412090Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-07T11:31:37.633972Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-07T11:29:32.412044Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-07T11:31:37.632745Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"normalizer.cc(51) LOG(INFO) precompiled_charsmap is empty. use identity normalization.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we have the model defined we can give it prompts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gemma_lm.generate(\"What is the meaning of life?\", max_length=64)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-07T11:51:58.009769Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-07T11:51:58.010604Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-07T11:52:45.597430Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-07T11:51:58.010536Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-07T11:52:45.596280Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING: All log messages before absl::InitializeLog() is called are written to STDERR\nI0000 00:00:1725709931.817510     100 service.cc:145] XLA service 0x7bb0ce11d790 initialized for platform Host (this does not guarantee that XLA will be used).
