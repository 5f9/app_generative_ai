    "\n",
    "In this part, we'll cover how to generate content and structure responses using specific formats or instructions to tailor outputs within the life insurance context. By mastering these patterns, you can guide Generative AI to produce content that meets your exact needsâ€”whether it's drafting policy summaries, creating client communications, or extracting specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Template Pattern\n",
    "The Template Pattern involves providing a predefined structure or format that the AI should follow when generating its response. This is particularly useful when you need outputs in a specific layout or style.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using the following template, create a life insurance policy summary:\n",
